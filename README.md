Project Proposal:
We propose to develop a machine learning model that learns technical documents to provide a summary of input documents of the same field. 

The steps to the project:
Find a technical corpus
Clean corpus
Vectorize corpus
Choose an ML Model (RNN, K-mean, Seq to Seq)
Test model and record model stats.
Design a portal to demonstrate model stats.
